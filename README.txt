dependencies see addon-info.json (VAM knows how to install them or get them from my githb page.)

This plugin provides an :SBT command which should allow you to run SBT actions (requiring python).
REPL completion supported. However if sbt ask a unexpected question everyhting "hangs" infinitely :(

If you're interested in helping resurrecting the scala vim ensime branch .. ping back
